BoarHelper is a console app (and will be a discord bot) designed to be used alongside the BoarBot discord bot and gives some information that BoarBot does not.
To download, simply download and run BoarHelper.exe.

Currently, there are three modes that can be used.

Blessings mode will use any amount of Blessings and Miracle Charms to calculate the chances of getting any amount of any rarity of boar. Currently, mixing rarities is not possible.
